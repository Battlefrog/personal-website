    <h2 id="me">Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Broc.</p>
    <p>I'm a Computer Scientist and Game Developer, creating games under <a href="https://www.sledgehogsoftware.com">Sledgehog Software</a>.</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm studying Computer Science at the <strong>University of Central Florida</strong>. I previously earned an <strong>Associate's Degree</strong> from <strong>Daytona State College</strong> in May 2024.</p>
    <p>Before that, I attended <strong>Florida State University</strong> and graduated from <strong>New Smyrna Beach High School</strong> in 2019.</p>

    <h3>C/C++</h3>
    <p>I began learning <strong>C++</strong> in 8th grade through the <a href="https://github.com/planetchili/chili_framework">Chili Framework</a>, making it my first programming language.</p>
    <p>Later, I learned <strong>C</strong> while at the <strong>University of Central Florida</strong>, learning the core concepts of Computer Science.</p>
    <p>I've experimented with libraries such as <strong>Raylib</strong> and <strong>SFML</strong>, as well as graphics APIs like <strong>OpenGL</strong> and <strong>Vulkan</strong>.</p>    
    <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
    <p>I have a solid foundation in core data structures and algorithms, with experience in their implementation and application in various projects and coursework.
    <h3>Linux</h3>
    <p>I am proficient with the <strong>Linux</strong> operating system and command-line operations, using it as my primary OS of choice. I have basic experience with Linux server setup, primarily for hosting Minecraft and WordPress. Additionally, I am familiar with package managers such as <strong>apt</strong> and <strong>pacman</strong>.</p>    
    <h3>Java</h3>
    <p>I learned <strong>Java</strong> through the <strong>AP Computer Science A</strong> course in high school, where I built a strong foundation in <strong>object-oriented programming</strong>.</p>
    <h3>C#</h3>
    <p>I use <strong>C#</strong> in conjunction with <strong>Unity</strong> for game development. Additionally, I have also experimented with <strong>WPF</strong> for desktop applications and frameworks like <strong>MonoGame</strong> and <strong>XNA</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Godot Engine</h3>
    <p>The Godot Engine is my primary tool for game development, with multiple years of experience using <strong>Godot 3.x</strong> and <strong>Godot 4.x</strong>. I am currently creating <strong>A Frail Qubit</strong>, an upcoming game set to release on Steam.</p>    
    <h3>Python</h3>
    <p>I was introduced to <strong>Python</strong> during my time at <strong>Daytona State College</strong>. I have since used it extensively for solving challenges on <strong>LeetCode</strong>, and experimenting with Deep Learning applications with <strong>Keras</strong>.</p>
    <h3>HTML, CSS, JS</h3>
    <p>I have a solid understanding of <b>HTML & CSS</b> to create websites. I have also used <b>JavaScript</b>, mostly to create Discord bots.</p>
